Heyyyyy,
 We are learning how to use GitHub.

To gain remote access to your repo,
Generate a new respository on your Github profile
Must be the same name as the folder used for the files
Github will create a link for your repo and take you to a page for the next steps with some minor tips

Sometimes we need to open an access code and on Github found in the developer settings to access our repository.
Got to classic token, generate a new token
Set a note for the token
Check the first repo (selects all)
Generate the code & choose an expiration length (30,60 or 90 days)
Copy the code
Paste the code into the password option
It should look like:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Sarai-ii/new_project.git
git push -u origin main (or master deoednin)
(if username is prompted then access code is needed)
type in username
email associated with the github account will show up
password will pop up with a key (the key icon indicates that the password will not show when being typed)
paste the access code into the password section, 
press enter
It's now connected to your Github acct
